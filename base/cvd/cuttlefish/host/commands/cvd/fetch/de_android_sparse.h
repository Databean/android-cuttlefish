 * Converts any Android-Sparse image files in `image_files` to raw image files.

 * Android-Sparse is a file format invented by Android that optimizes for
 * chunks of zeroes or repeated data. The Android build system can produce
 * sparse files to save on size of disk files after they are extracted from a
 * disk file, as the imag eflashing process also can handle Android-Sparse
 * images.
 *
 * crosvm has read-only support for Android-Sparse files, but QEMU does not
 * support them.
